            Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
            behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
            little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young,
            global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not
            only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
