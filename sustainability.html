        <p class="visible_sustainability">
          Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
          behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
          little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young, global
          fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for
          own sake, but for all future generations to come.

          Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
          behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
          little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young, global
          fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for
          own sake, but for all future generations to come. Since day one, we
          have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an
          absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning the
          social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we
          operate. As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”.
          We believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
          future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products
          in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will
          start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and
          we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are
          all in this together! As a company with great manufacturing
          activities, we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to
          make as green a production as possible, and we will continue to launch
          new initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further.

        <h2>WATER</h2>
        <p class="visible_sustainability">
          The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
          worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination
          of drinking water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our
          production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the
          environment and to ensure local access to clean water.

          production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the
          environment and to ensure local access to clean water. All cotton used
          for production of SILFEN bags is either made from eco-friendly or
          organic cotton. This means that there is much less consumption of
          water throughout production and treatment of our cotton, than
          conventional cotton products. In 2020 we will introduce a new
          collection of bags made from a new material; rPET or Recycled
          Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made
          from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled plastic
          bottles gathered from all over the world.

          it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct

          ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
          suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our
          factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put
          their children in school. Team Silfen provides insurance to all our
          hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also
          grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial
          stability after retirement. We support the different religions of
          employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc.
          at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the
          employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
          issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
          etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
          always crafted in a responsible manner. All our manufacturers are
          SA8000 certified.

        <p class="visible_sustainability">
          Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known
          as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly
          or organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption
          than conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
          eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
          SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.
