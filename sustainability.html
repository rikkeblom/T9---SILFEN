              In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and
              we have continued to this since then. We make sure that all
              non-leather material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100%
              vegan, promising that these products do not contain any parts from
              animals.

              in rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well
              known as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles
              that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled
              material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
              oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over
              the world. <span class="read-more-target"> With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the
                impact of pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this
                awareness to our customers, and to encourage them to help clean
